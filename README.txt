BLOCK BACKGROUND COLOR
---------------------

Started to port this module. Not working. I understand that Blocks might make this a big deal. Looking for help from someone smarter than myself. (I tested, it works on Drupal 7)

Block Background Module will help to set a custom background color to the blocks. The user can choose the color using a color picker field for each block in the block configuration page.

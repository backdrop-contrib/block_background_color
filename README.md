Block Background Color
======================

Block Background Color will help to set a custom background color to the 
blocks. The user can choose the color using a color picker field for each 
block in the block configuration page.

Alternative Modules
-------------------

We also recommend looking at the [Configurable Block Styles](https://backdropcms.org/project/configurable_block_style) 
module which also allows you to set the background color for blocks, but 
provides additional block configuration settings as well. 

Installation
------------

 - Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
   https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
   
Usage
-------------

- Access the "Configure Block" dialog
- Click on the color picker under "Background Color"
- Select the color using RGB, HEX, HSL, the paletter, or the color picker
